This project is a little expericent to create a form component system with React 16, Hooks and boostrap 4 CSS. You can play around at https://rt-cff.github.io/react-form-demo

It is designed to avoid handcrafting props to every input conmponents such as value, onChange handleer, size, width..etc. It also allows passing in custom input components that combines multiple input together.

TODO:
  - Add more input components
  - Add validation rules
  - Add Demo Page
